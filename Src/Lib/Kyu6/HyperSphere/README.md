To pass this kata you are required to complete the function in_sphere?. You will be given an array of cordinates and a radius. The function should return true if the coordinates describe a point within the given radius of the origin ([0,0...0]). A point with no co-ordinates should return true. (In zero dimensions all points are the same point)

In two dimensions the condition that any [x,y] co-ordinate lies in a circle is:-

x^2 + y^2 <= radius^2

This generalises to higer dimensions as follows.

x1^2 + x2^2 + ... xn^2 <= radius^2
